 Intro to discrete math - Bonn 20/21
This is my programming folder for my introductory course into discrete mathematics at Bonn University.
The course will mainly focus on graphs and algorithms on graphs. (at least to my understanding)

Important information:
The basic functionality of the graph class was not implemented by me, but by the lecturer and another professor when they wrote an introductory book about Algorithms. It was meant to be used by readers of the book and by students of lectures in discrete mathematics.
